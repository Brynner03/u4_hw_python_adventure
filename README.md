# Build Your Own Adventure (Python)


## Overview
In this deliverable, we'll be building our own adventure to practice with control flow in python.

## Getting Started

- `Fork` and `clone` this repository


## Deliverables

Build your own cli adventure.

Test your file by `python3 main.py`.

Using if/elif/else, create an adventure game that a user can play. You should be able to accept a user input from the terminal and a user should be able to choose different paths.

- Must have a minimum of 4 paths a user can take.
- Must have a play again option, maybe have a play game function?

## Helpful Hints

- `input()` is a useful python method that accepts terminal input.
- `int()` is useful to convert an input to an integer.
- `str()` is useful to convert an input to a string.
